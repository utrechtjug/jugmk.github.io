   talk: "Managers and Customers - The Missing Manual"
   speakers: [0]
   istalk: "yes"
   description: >
      <p>Software projects would be so easy and pleasant without managers and customers. 
      These non-technical people are a strange breed of animal. 
      They work in IT projects, but have no idea about technology. 
      They are the boss and want to make the big decisions, but do not know what they are talking about. 
      Managers care more about Excel sheets and project plans than running software. 
      Customers want everything, by yesterday, first time right and for free of course. 
      And they love meetings, oh the meetings...</p>

      <p>In this talk, Corsin tries to provide parts of the missing manual for non-technical managers and customers. 
      Think of it as a Sir David Attenborough-type nature documentary.</p>

   speakers: [8]
   istalk: "yes"
   description: >
      My greatest passion in programming are functional languages, the languages that were believed to be the future of AI. 
      Now they are prevailing in all other areas and concepts like Reactive, Immutable, Stateless are becoming part of our daily work. 
      Which is great, but the question is how Reactive do we really need to be. 
      I want to give my "point de vue" based on my experience with using Javascript frontend technologies for big enterprise projects.

      Perhaps the easiest way  to run your application at AWS as a multi Docker container app is to use Amazon ElasticBeanstalk. 
      It allows you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud and let Amazon care about the infrastructure magic.
      In my presentation I'll share my experience of using ElasticBeanstalk and automating deployment with Jenkins.

      This talk guides you from most simple(and bad) implementations towards more complicated and secure solutions.
      While doing that you will get the basic ideas about cryptography terms like nonce, hashes, salt, rainbow-tables, key stretching as well as terms like User Enumeration, Password Enumeration etc.

   speakers: [15]
   istalk: "yes"
   description: >
      <p>
      Microservices are hot topic these days. 
      And it's not just another hype, but the reality - the new  deployment and delivery model of scaling and maintaining single app features lead to completely new development model.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most of the platform vendors from the Java space followed the trends and came up with powerful products in that space. As always Java EE was accused for being late for the party. Individual vendors have their own solutions, but they are still far from standard. The MicroProfile initiative is a step in the right direction. There vendors work together to define what a microservice runtime is and implement it on top of standard technologies.
      </p>
      <p>Join this session to learn more about the initiative and see it in action. </p>
