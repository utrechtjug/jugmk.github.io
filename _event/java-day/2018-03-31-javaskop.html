   talk: "Going Reactive with Spring 5"
   speakers: [1]
   istalk: "yes"
   description: >
      <p>In recent times, Reactive Programming has gained a lot of popularity. It is not a “silver bullet” nor it is a solution for every problem. Yet, it is a paradigm to build applications which are non-blocking, event-driven and asynchronous and require a small number of threads to scale.</p> 
      <p>Spring Framework 5 embraces Reactive Streams and Reactor for its own reactive use, as well as in many of its core APIs. It also adds an ability to code in a declarative way, as opposed to imperatively, resulting in more responsive and resilient applications. On top of that, you are given an amazing toolbox of functions to combine, create and filter any data stream. It becomes easy to support input and output streaming scenarios for microservices, scatter/gather, data ingestion, and so on. This presentation is about support and building blocks for reactive programming, that come with the latest versions of Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.</p>

   talk: "Microservices external API and data management patterns"
   speakers: [7]
   istalk: "yes"
   description: >
      <p>Several years since they have been introduced to the world, microservices continue to be the “hot topic” among developers, now more than ever. The benefits which this architectural style brings when developing large and complex application are well known, but so are its pitfalls.</p>
      <p>As with everything else, using microservices comes with a price in the form of increased complexity of the technical solution. Service communication over the wire introduces latency and is prone to network failures, data scattered among multiple database systems can’t be changed within a single transaction, etc. The adoption of microservices patterns can ease this pain.</p> 
      <p>The presentation explores some of the commonly used microservices patterns related to external API design and data management which allow the data to be recorded into, replicated among and read from multiple microservices in an efficient manner.</p>
